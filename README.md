# COMP30760 ASSIGNMENT 1
By Brian Byrne (18391933).

This is a visualization  and analysis of data collected from the "COVID-19 API" ([https://covid19api.com/]), a free API with data regarding the ever-growing Coronavirus infection rates. For the purpose of the assignment I decided to use the data of the following countries to draw interesting and comparable insights after careful consideration:
* <b>Ireland</b> - Most relevant to me personally as a resident, and the country has recently entered lockdown, which may be a factor in the results.
* <b>Sweden</b> - Also an EU country, Sweden have decided against a traditional lockdown, in favour of a "Life must go on" policy. It will be interesting to see how their daily cases compare to Ireland's. Sweden's population is approx. twice that of Ireland.
* <b>Croatia</b> - is another EU counrty with a similar population to Ireland, this will be useful for comparison of cases and infection rates.

Furthermore, I have decided to focus solely on the dates of the dates in October, the most recent month available, as Ireland went into a level 5 (highest) lockdown during this month.

# COMP30760 ASSIGNMENT 2
By Brian Byrne (18391933)

This is a visualization and analysis of data collected from Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports (accessed from http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/COMP30760/mobility.html ). The datasets show a precentage change in the amount of national movement at 6 different location category types (retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, residential) during the COVID-19 pandemic versus movement from before the pandemic (represented by a baseline at 0). For the purpose of the assignment I decided to use the data of the following countries to draw interesting and comparable insights after careful consideration:
* <b>Ireland</b>- Relevant to me as I am a resident and I would like to see how the implementation of two lockdowns effected movement in the counrty.
* <b>Sweden</b>- Like Ireland, Sweden is an EU Country that has decided in favour of a "Life must go on" policy. It will be interesting to see what effect this policy has on movement. Sweden also has a Scandinavian, cool climate which may also influence movement.
* <b>New Zealand</b>- Like Ireland, New Zealand also went into lockdown. However after closing borders for the pandemic, New Zealand have decided to revert back to Level 1 restrictions, reopening the entire country and lifting restrictions, with the only requirement being that people must still make details available for possible contact tracing.
